## Description

This application helps users view and manage a company database that contains information about departments, roles, and employees. The user profile for this app is anyone who needs to quickly review and make changes to company employee records — for example, a business manager, HR, or a business owner. 

App functionality: 

- When a user starts a command line application, they are presented with the following options:
  - View all departments
  - View all roles
  - View all employees
  - Add a department
  - Add a role
  - Add an employee
  - Update an employee
- When a user selects "View all departments," they can see a formatted table showing:
  - Department names
  - Department ids
- When a user selects "View all roles," they can see a formatted table showing:
  - Role id
  - Job title
  - Department the role belongs to
  - Salary for that role
- When a user selects "View all employees," they can see a formatted table showing:
  - Employee id
  - Employee's first name
  - Employee's last name
  - Employee job title 
  - Employee department 
  - Salary 
  - Employee manager
- When a user selects "Add a department," they are prompted to enter the name of the department, and that department is added to the database
- When a user selects "Add a role," they are prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role, and that role is added to the database
- When a user selects "Add an employee," they are prompted to enter the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
- When a user selects "Update an employee," they are prompted to choose an employee and their new role, and that information is updated in the database
